# Weather-API-Practice

12/31/2020
Yesterday, I was able to get the fetch function to work when being called by an event listener. Today, I mostly played with the design of the page, and made the displayed information a bit easier to read. This is my first successful usage of an API outside a tutorial. Can't wait to continue to gain experience working with APIs!
